          <td>Dominican Republic's most beeautiful parts are the sand, the surf, and the beach. It is a tropical destination with lots of sun and heat, especially in the summer, when the temperatures range from 25 to 33 degrees celcius. The waves are strong yet relaxing, and the sea air makes you feel at ease.</td>
          <td>I love to eat, and you won't be dissapointed in Barcelona, Spain. The tapas there are incredible. They are mouth-watering mosrsels of joy. They are only a few euros each and can be as simple as "Pan Con Jamon," a ham sandwich, or as exotic as a multi-layered seafood one. All of them go together with a tall, fruity cocktail, withought alcohol, of course!</td>
          <td>The mexican heat is all you need. If you are active, it is the place to be. It offers horsebcak riding on beautiful sandy beaches. The sea is stong, which is excellent for surfing or buggy boarding The music is lively, the people friendly, and the tamales are to die for. Don't forget to practice your Spanish, as it will come in handy.</td>
