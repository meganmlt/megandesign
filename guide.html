          <td>Punta Cana Vista Sol is the place to be. The food is incredible, especially the daily all-you-can-eat buffet. They serve a wide range of fresh foods, from beef, pork and fish to vegetarian dishes. The fresh fruits are plentiful, and the deserts are out of this world.</td>
          <td>Las Ramblas is a famous pedestrian street that offers eateries, restaurants, bars and markets. It stretches through the city and ends in front of the beach at the Christopher Columbus monument. In Gaudi Park, all the structures and artwork from Gaudi is all in one place that offers self guided tours. A temple built by Gaudi "La Sagrada Familia" is more than 135 years old. Exceptiomal architecture by the late Antoni Gaudi.</td>
          <td>Puerto Vallarta is a holiday beach town that has a lot of souvenir shops with a giant boardwalk that stretches along the beach. They have nightly shows such as circus and street performers. After a day at the beach, it is good to take a long walk and look at the action. You can even buy a pice of cake by the ocean, just like the song. Chocolate is my favourite!</td>

Also, war plenty of sunblock, or you will come back home red like a tomato. Last but not least dont forget your sunglasses, because you have to be cool to stroll along South Beach Miami.</td>
          <td>Fine dining in Canada's wine country. Go and explore Canada's wine tasting at local wineries near Niagara Falls. You can go up Niagara's Skywheel and see a breathtaking view of the falls, or take the made of the mist Ferry to go and see the falls up close. PS: Don't forget your umbrella as you might get a little wet.</td>
